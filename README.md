 _Why the shift you ask?_
 <br/>
 I have always been interested in technology and programming but was scared and wasn't sure if I would be able to do it. But, after my bachelors and working for a while and being drawn to tech, even if it was in form of tech support at home or work which made me want to take the jump and get a degree in IT. 
 
 ### What am I upto now? ###
 I just graduated from my Masters, after doing my last semester on Zoom! Yayy, 2020! 
 <br/>
 Iâ€™m currently working on MERN stack project to get better in full stack development.
 <br/>
 I'm also trying to break into the job market _(Yayy!! 2020 again)_
